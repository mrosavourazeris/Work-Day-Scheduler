# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This repository contains my completed code for week 5's homework. In this week's homework, we were tasked with creating a work day planner that anyone can use to keep track of their schedule during work hours. 

## Details Explained

This planner shows a time table for a standard work day, 9 AM to 5 PM. Time's rows are categorized by 3 different colors. If the time's row is gray, then that row is in the past. If the time's row is red, that is the current hour. If the time's row is green, that row's time is in the future. When a user enters text into the time's row and hits the save button, the content within that row will be saved even if the page is refreshed.
